Justification of $whatever-name$

HTML Forms. I want forms, and I suspect you do too.

Things I want:

* All the standard HTML 4 elements with full customizing; I want to be
  able to specify classes, IDs, obscure and non-standard attributes,
  preferably with hiccup/css style #id and .class short cuts.

* Pick, choose and modify: I might not like a particular element's
  generator function, so I need to be able to replace or extend it.

* Wrappers / HTML decoration: I want to be able to wrap <label>s and
  validation messages around elements automatically, but sometimes I
  don't want that, or I may want "loose" labels referring to IDs, and
  I don't want any option to be especially cumbersome.

* HTML 5 elements and custom elements. I want the same interface to
  work for current, future and custum UI elements.

* Fool proof customizable parameter/value/error passing. Give me a
  simple way of passing a form-full of data to a view without a lot of
  annoying (and thread-specific) bindings. And give me the option of
  passing in that data in a different format without having to
  re-write the core functions.

* Let me do all of the above using whatever mixture of static and
  dynamic constructs are useful for the job.

Here's my attempt. Again with the functions.
